# N-Queens
 It looks like you've provided a Python code snippet that implements the N-Queens problem using local search techniques. The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle where you need to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.

This code defines a class NQueensState that represents a state of the N-Queens problem. Here's an overview of what the code does:

Import necessary libraries: The code imports math, matplotlib.pyplot, sys, and random.

Class NQueensState: This class represents a state of the N-Queens problem. It has several methods and attributes to manage the state of the board.

__init__: Initializes the state. If a list of queens' positions is provided, it uses that list; otherwise, it generates a random initial arrangement of queens.

conflicts: Returns the number of conflicts (threats between queens).

_compute_conflicts: Calculates the number of conflicts between queens and stores it in num_conflicts.

neighbors: Generates and yields neighboring states by swapping queens in different positions.

best_neighbors: Returns the best neighboring state with the lowest number of conflicts.

random_neighbors: Returns a random neighboring state obtained by swapping two randomly chosen queens.

plot: Plots the current state of the board, showing queens' positions. It uses matplotlib to create a visual representation of the board.

Creating a State and Plotting: An instance of NQueensState is created with N=16, and then its plot method is called to visualize the arrangement of queens on the board.

Visualization: The plot method generates a graphical representation of the N-Queens board using matplotlib. Queens are represented by "Q" symbols, and conflicts between queens are indicated by their positions.
